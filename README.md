I have created a single controller to handle requests
. The service files are part of the package com.example.blackrock.services;

The dto, requestDto, and responseSto are part of the package com.example.blackrock.dto and com.example.blackrock.responseDto respectively.

3. gradle used is v9, install that as well
4. all services are runnig on port 5547
